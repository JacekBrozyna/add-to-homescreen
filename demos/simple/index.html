    <p>Major League's opening day is supposed to be a time-honored American tradition, but this year <A href="https://sports.yahoo.com/cubs-rangers-fans-miss-opening-ceremonies-due-to-long-lines-outside-stadium-212032801.html

            mobile applications kept fans from enjoying games all over the country, including the Texas Rangers and

    <p>Instead of buying 2 pound chicken fingers, hot dogs, hamburgers and lots of beer while cheering for the home team
        fans spent over an hour lined up to enter stadiums.</p>
    <p>Many reported not entering stadiums till the 3rd or 4th innings. Unless you are a Dodger's fan that is
        unacceptable.</p>
    <p>While opening day is the source of logistical issues for any business, when things go real bad due to modern
        technology it can go real bad.</p>
    <p>And that is what happened during the 2019 major league baseball opening day games.</p>
    <p>I am acutely aware of how events like baseball game tickets work. My dad used to work at the Texas Rangers park
        and
        finished the last two seasons working one of the stadium entrances scanning tickets.</p>
    <p>He is a good story teller and well has shared many great stories of life at the old ballpark. Those stories even
        inspired one of the demonstration progressive web apps I included in my <a href="https://amzn.to/2uTCevY"
            target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">PWA development book</a> last year.</p>
    <p>And that is why I know a <a href="pwa/">Progressive Web Application</a> would have solved many of the issues fans
        experienced
        trying to access their game tickets.</p>
    <p>If you are new to progressive web apps (PWA) they are modern web applications that work across browsers and
        platforms. They are designed to optimize mobile application experiences by leveraging modern capabilities and
        best
        practices.</p>
    <p>PWAs can work offline thanks to local caching, take advantage of geo-location, push notifications and more.</p>
    <p>Let's dive into the MLB fan issues and review how progressive web applications would have solved them.</p>
    <h2>What Does the MLB Ballpark App Feature?</h2>
    <p>To incentivize customers to download an app there has to be something compelling first. So lets review the
        <i>features</i>
        offered by the MLB Ballpark app.</p>
    <div class="mx-2 col-md-6 my-1 py-1">
        <p><i class="my-1 fas fa-baseball-ball mx-2"></i><b>Ticket Management</b></p>
        <p><i class="my-1 fas fa-baseball-ball mx-2"></i><b>Team Schedule</b></p>
        <p><i class="my-1 fas fa-baseball-ball mx-2"></i><b>Stadium Map & Directory</b></p>
        <p><i class="my-1 fas fa-baseball-ball mx-2"></i><b>Rewards Program</b></p>
        <p><i class="my-1 fas fa-baseball-ball mx-2"></i><b>Scores & Photos of Your Games</b></p>
        <p><i class="my-1 fas fa-baseball-ball mx-2"></i><b>Designating Favorite Team</b></p>
        <p><i class="my-1 fas fa-baseball-ball mx-2"></i><b>Social Media</b></p>
        <p><i class="my-1 fas fa-baseball-ball mx-2"></i><b>Seat Upgrade Ability</b></p>
        <p><i class="my-1 fas fa-baseball-ball mx-2"></i><b>Directions & Parking Info</b></p>
    </div>
    <p>By compelling I mean the functionality and data really needs to require an app to use. I know there is nothing in
        the list that could not be equally accessed via a web application. So where is the incentive?</p>
    <p>Most of the features are just rendering data, which the web has always excelled doing. I have personally built
        dozens of applications that allow content customization, like the team favoriting. E-commerce is a no brainer,
        so
        ticket purchase and upgrades are doable. Maps and directions have been available for years and geo-location was
        added to the web over a year ago.</p>
    <p>I even built an app similar to the stadium map & directory functionality.</p>
    <p>There is nothing here that compels me to go through the 8 or more steps to download this app and consume several
        100MB of my limited disk space to run. Especially when a 100kb or less of HTML, CSS and a little JavaScript will
        do.</p>

    <h2 id="how-bad-tech-created-a-bad-fan-experience">How Bad Tech Created a Bad Fan Experience</h2>
    <p>Even though major league baseball franchises appear to be independent, they aren't. They all use the same
        underlying
        technology stack for their 'consumer' experience.</p>
    <p>This includes ticket purchases and digital access. You can still buy tickets at the stadium box office, but most
        fans lean on modern digital tickets.</p>
    <p>This year MLB policy limited tickets to just physical tickets printed on official franchise stock or within the
        official MLB Ballpark app.</p>
    <p>I get the need to control ticket fraud by eliminating home printed tickets, which can be fabricated. But forcing
        fans to download an app is a bad idea, especially when that app does not offer anything a progressive web
        application could not provide.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>&quot;...also the experience of standing in a line for 45 minutes because overdramatic security measures and
            some pointless new technology means that fans are slowly being let into the ballpark one at a time.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>&quot;According to a source at the Phillies game, one security guard said that teams’ move to paperless
            tickets
            were to blame, as fans would get to the front of the line, attempt to use the official app that contained
            their
            tickets, and then watch helplessly as the app would fail.&quot;</p>

    <p>I do not have any inside insight into how the MLB Ballpark app works or the back-end technology, but I have an
        idea
        based on my 25 years of professional software development experience.</p>
    <p>I have built a sports ticket management solution in the past, so I know some of the unique requirements these
        systems have.</p>

    <p>Let's establish some usage expectations so you will know what should be accounted for when designing a system.
    </p>
    <p>There are 32 teams, which means no more than 16 games in a day. There are actually 15 on Thursday. The game start
        times were staggered through out the day, typically 3-4 starting within an hour of each other.</p>
    <p>Major league stadiums can seat between 35-45,000 fans and opening day is typically sold out across the lead.</p>
    <p>Tickets are typically purchased on groups, 2-6 from my experience. Which means there are about 10,000 possible
        'ticket holders' that would have the digital ticket.</p>
    <p>Let's say 20% use printed tickets, so we are down to possibly 8000 apps to scan at the stadium entrances.</p>
    <p>Assume there are 40 possible lines and there are most likely more on average, that means each line would need to
        scan 200 groups of tickets.</p>
    <p>At 15 seconds per scan (a generous amount of time) it should take about 50 minutes for fans to enter the stadium.
    </p>
    <p>Wait there is more...</p>
